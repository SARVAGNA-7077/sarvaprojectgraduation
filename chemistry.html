  <h1>Relavance of CHEMISTRY</h1>
  <p>Chemistry is important because everything you do is chemistry! Even your body is made of chemicals. Chemical reactions occur when you breathe, eat, or just sit there reading. All matter is made of chemicals, so the importance of chemistry is that it's the study of everything.<br>Food is made from chemicals. Many of the changes you observe in the world around you are caused by chemical reactions. Examples include leaves changing colors, cooking food and getting yourself clean. Knowing some chemistry can help you make day-to-day decisions that affect your life.</p>
  <h2>METALS AND NON METALS</h2>
  <blockquote><h2>PERIODIC TABLE-</h2></blockquote>
  <blockquote><p>Periodic table consists of Elements which can be grouped as METALS, NON METALS AND METALLOIDS. The rows of the periodic table are called periods while coloumns are called as gruops. There are a total of 7 Rows and 18 Coloumns. The elements in a
    coloumn have the same valency electrons. In a row, the elements are arranged in increasing atomic number. Atomic number is the number of protons present in the nucleus of an element. Valency electrons are the number of electrons in the outer most
    shell in the element. <br> Most of the elements in the periodic table are metals. There are 91 metals, 19 nonmetals and 7 mettaloids.</p></blockquote>


  <blockquote><h2>What are metals, non metals and metalloids? </h2></blockquote>
  <blockquote><p><br>The materials which do not posses the characteristics of metals are known as <b>NON METALS</b>.
    Ex- SULPHUR, PHOSPHURUS, CARBON AND OXYGEN. <br>
    The materials which posses the properties of both metals and non metals are known as <b>METALLOIDS</b>.Examples- Boron, Silicon, Germanium, Arsenic, Tellurium, Antimony and Polonium.</p>


  <blockquote><h2>METALS</h2></blockquote>
  <blockquote><p>The materials that posses the characteristics of being hard, malleable, shiny, fusible and ductile, are called as <b>METALS</b>. Ex- IRON, ALLUMINIUM, GOLD AND COPPER. </p>
<blockquote>  <h4>Types of Metals</h4></blockquote>
  <blockquote><p>There are 5 types of metals. They are ALKALI METALS, ALKALI EARTH METALS, TRANSITION METALS, LANTHANIDES AND ACTINIDES. <br>

    <b>Alkali metals </b>react with water to produce heat, hydrogen gas, and the corresponding metal hydroxide.<br>

    <b>Alkaline-earth metals</b> comprise Group 2 of the periodic table. The elements are beryllium (Be), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), and radium (Ra).<br>

    <b>Transition metals</b> are the metals which often do not react much with other metals. They are less reactive compared to the other metals.<br>

    <b>Lanthanides</b> are the members of the 15 naturally occurring metallic chemical elements, whose atomic numbers fall between 57 (Lanthanum) and 71 (Lutetium). Lanthanides have similarities in their physical and chemical properties and have many
    industrial and scientific uses .<br>

    <b>Actinides</b> are elements with atomic numbers from 90 to 103 following element Actinium. They include naturally occurring elements of thorium, protactinium and uranium and eleven transuranic i.e., artificially produced by nuclear reactions.
    Nevertheless, all actinides are radioactive.<br>

    <b>Alloys</b>- Many metals that we use today are alloys. Alloys are metals that combine 2 or more elements. They could also be called metallic compounds. Alloys are stronger and harder than pure metals. Example Steel, Stainless steel (Fe + C),
    Brass(Cu + Zn) and Bronze (Cu + Sn).
  </p></blockquote>

  <blockquote><h2>Non Metals</h2></blockquote>
  <blockquote><p>The materials which do not posses the characteristics of metals are known as NON METALS. Ex- SULPHUR, PHOSPHURUS, CARBON AND OXYGEN.<br>Non metals are the most abundant elemts in the universe. Hydrogen is the number 1 most abundant element with
    oxygen, carbon and nitrogen being the 3,4 and 7th most abundant elements.<br>
    Our human body consists of oxygen (65%), carbon (18%), hydrogen (10%) and nitrogen 3 (3%)<br>
    Our Earth's crust has oxygen which is the single most abundant element</p></blockquote>
  <blockquote><h2>About mettaloids-
  </h2></blockquote>
  <blockquote><p>The six commonly recognised metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. ... Typical metalloids have a metallic appearance, but they are brittle and only fair conductors of electricity. Chemically, they behave
    mostly
    as nonmetals. They can form alloys with metals. They have both the property of metals and non metals. </p></blockquote>

  <blockquote><h2>What is ACID AND BASES?</h2></blockquote>
<blockquote>  <p>

    <strong>Acids</strong> are substances which furnishes H<sup>+</sup> ions as the only positively charged ions upon dissolution in water.<br><strong>Bases</strong> are substances which furnishes OH<sup>-</sup> ions as the only negativly charged
    ions upon dissolution in water. When there are more hydrogen ions, the substance is acidic. When there are more Hydroxide ions, the substance is basic.

  <blockquote><h2>Strong / Weak ACID and BASES</h2></blockquote>

  <blockquote><p>The acids and bases which undergo complete ionization when dissolved in water and furnish very large concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions or OH <sup>-</sup> ions, respectively are called strong acid and bases. <br> The acids and bases which
    ionizes partially when dissolved in water and furnish very less concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions or OH <sup>-</sup> ions, respectively are called weak acid and bases</p>
  <!--Weak acid and bases-->

  <blockquote><h2>pH Scale</h2></blockquote>
  <blockquote><p>pH Scale is a ruler that we can use to measure how acidic or basic a substance is. There are 14 different possible point values on the scale and each one represents a possible level of acidity or baseness<br>A substance is acidic if it has a pH level 0 through 7 where 0 is the most acidic. <br> A substance is basic if it has a pH of 7 through 14 where 14 is the most basic<br> If a substance has a pH of 7 it is neutral. Examples- Water (7), Blood (7.35 - 7.45)</p>
