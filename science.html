    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Importance of <b><i>SCIENCE</i></b></h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Have you ever wondered how we manage to stay cool in the face of air conditioning, fans, and coolers? Humans are naturally curious beings who are interested and curious about the reasons for events. However, how to study the qualities of a certain species or object was a major concern for all humans. There are scientists who have grouped the study of several subjects under the broad discipline of science.</p>


<p>Human beings have benefitted immensely from science. Man, as a logical being, has been strange in his pursuit of environmental concerns, which has resulted in several discoveries in various parts of the globe. The study of the environment is known as science. Animals, chemicals, the force, the earth, plants, and other subjects are studied in several fields of science such as physics, chemistry, and biology.</p>


<p>Science is very essential in our daily life. We use science in day to day life. We wake up and use paste and brush which both are given by science. We use science in cooking, eating, clothing etc. Baking involves basic knowledge of science and baking machines such as oven, microwaves are endowments of science.<br><br>


Can you imagine your life without electricity? If not, then you must know that electricity is also given by science.</p>

<p>Einstein said that: <Br></p><blockquote><p>
 <i> “All our science measured against reality, is primitive and childlike - and yet is the most precious thing we have.”</i>
</p>

      </blockquote>

<h3>ARTICLE 51 A</h3>
<p>The Fundamental Duty, given in Article 51 A(g) of the Indian Constitution clearly mentions the duty of the citizen to protect the environment. According to this article, it is the duty of every citizen to protect and preserve the natural environment (natural environment includes forest, rivers, lakes, and wildlife).</p>
<h3>My favourite scientist</h3>
<p>My favourite scientise is NIKOLA TESLA as he's a great scientist who invented many many use ful things such as Alternating Current, Tesla Coil, Robotics, Radio, Tesla Oscilator and Many More. Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production, transmission and application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission technology.<br> He was a great scientist which changed the modern technology. The remote control helps us in everything from T.V's to controlled sattilites. The Alternating Current also helped in many ways such as  electric cars. <br>The name "TESLA" came from Nekola tesla which was inspired by  different people to invent the company "T E S L A". </p>

<h3>The interconnection between the 3 types of SCIENCE</h3>
<p>Biology, Physics and Chemistry is interconnected by various types of things. Biology explains how our body works. Chemistry explains how and types of blood variations and the correct maintenence of our body with certain foods and Physics helps us in the motion of us(Moving front, Back and other limbs and important functions.).</p>
