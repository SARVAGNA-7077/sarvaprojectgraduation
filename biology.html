  <h2>ORIGIN OF PLANTS</h2>


  <p>Plant is a multicellular eukaryote. That means it is made of cells that have nucleus and membrane bound organnelles. A billion years years ago, there were no plants on land.There were algae acting as plants on the water or seas. The algae soon
    adapted to form land plants instead of sea plants which gave rise to the first plants on the land. To prove this, the Modern green algae and the plants have the same cell walls that contains cellulose. Both groups use the same type of chlorophyll
    in photosynthesis and also store food in the form of starch. The plants have started on land around 440 Million years ago. They were simple plants that don't have leaves. <br>

    <h2>Adaptation in Plants</h2>
    <p>Land plants had to adapt to absorb water and nutrients. Few of the adaptatino techniques are- <br>1: The waxy cuticle creates a barrier which helps in the prevention of water from evaporating.<br>2: Development of seed was an adaptation technique for reproduction. The seed protects the embryo from drying out.<br>3: Development of roots to absorb water and nutrients from the soil.<br>4: Stem to provide suport for growth.<br>5: Vascular tissues helps in growing taller and transporting water and nutrients to each cell in the plant.<br>6: Leaf to prepare food for the plant through photosynthesis. </p>

    <h2>Alternations of generations in plants</h2>
<p>The lives of all plants include two stages, or alternating generatinos. One generatinon is the gametophyte generation and the other one is sporophyte generation. All the cells of the gametophyte are haploid including the gamets. All cells of a sporophyte generation are diploid. The spores produced in the sporophyte generation however are haploid. <br> <b>Mitosis</b>One cell divides and produces 2 genetically identical daughter cells.<br><b>Meiosis</b>One cell divides and produces cell or cells with half the number of chromosomes.</p> <img src="images/alternationsofgenerations.png" class="alternationsgenerations" alt="Alternations Of Generations">
