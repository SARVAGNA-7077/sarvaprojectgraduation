          <h3>Pythagoras Therom</h3>


          <aside>
    <img src="images/pythogoros.png" class="theorm">
</aside>

<p>The Pythagoras Thearom is a very important theorm which states that- a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>. This formula works for right angled triangles. To find any one side of the triangle, this equation is used. The a² represents the vertical line in the right triangle, the b² represents the horizontal line in the right triangle and the c² represents the hypotenuse or the slanting line of the right triangle. <br> An example of pythogoros theorm is: <br> A triangle has a vertical length of 6cm and a horizontal length of 8cm. What is the size of the Hypotenuse(Slanting side)?<br> First in the formula we do the square of the horizontal and the vertical. Which is- 6x6 = 36cm and 8x8 = 64cm. The square of the length of the hypotenuse is 36 + 64 = 100cm. The √100 = 10. So the length of the hypotenuse is 10cm. The hypotenuse is ALWAYS longer the other 2 side of the triangle. </p><br><br>
<h3>Congruency of TRIANGLES</h3>
<p>The three andlges of a triangle determine it's shape and it's three sides determine it's size. If the three angles and the three sides of triangle are respectively equal to the corresponding angles and sides of another triangle, the 2 triangles are said to be congruent. How every, to conclude that the triangles are congruent, it is not necessary that all the six corresponding elements of the two triangles are given to be congruent. <br><BR> Based on the study and experiments, the following results can be used to establish the congruence angles of the second triangle. Below are the given properties which helps us to check if the triangles are congruent.</p>
