    <h1>Welcome Everyone to the BHP (Big History Project!)</h1><hr class="sep-2" /><hr class="sep-2" />

    <h2>What is Big history?</h2><hr class="sep-2" /><h3>The Big History Project is a joint effort between teachers, scholars, scientists, and their supporters to bring a multi-disciplinary approach to knowledge to lifelong learners around the world. This was co-founded by Bill Gates and David Christian to enable the global teaching of the subject of Big History, which is described as "the attempt to understand, in a unified way, the history of Cosmos, Earth, Life and Humanity. Many of you might have learned social from the revolution or also from the harrapan civilization.... but Big History explains every thing from the Big Bang to the </h3><hr class="sep-2" />

    <h2>Now, let me tell you all about what i've learnt in the Big History Project</h2>

    <!-- The Formation Of Our Universe-->
       <div class="formationUniverse">
         <h1>THE FORMATION OF OUR UNIVERSE</h1>
          <h4>The universe, is all formed by a huge mass explosion called the BIG BANG.</h4><h4>THE BIG BANG, in a fraction of a second, created the 4 Fundemental forces of the universe namely- <b>> Gravity,<br> > Electromagnetism,<br> > Strong force and the<br> > weak force.</b></h4>
          <h4>Soon later, after the big band happened, within a span of 3 seconds, all of the matter has been created </h4>
          <h4>The universe was around 10 billion kelvins from the time Big Bang occurred. So, after the universe has cooled down, the first stars had lighted up the complete empty blank space</h4>
          <hr class="sep-2" /><h1>STARS LIGHT UP</h1>
            <h4>When you all see the night sky, it glows, the stars make it shinier! But how are star so bright and how are they formed?<br>When the big bang occurred there were really few elements. Only upto 7 or 8. Hydrogen covered around 75% of the universe while Helium covered about 24% of the universe. The remaining 1% is the other elements. When Huge clouds of Hydrogen and Helium Combine together, due to the friction, it creates HUGE amount of light. That lights up the gasses forming huge balls of FIRE, Stars. Stars are the main fuel for the light in the universe.</h4>
            <h4>The stars also helped in giving more elements. When a star dies, it's called as supernova. The super nova have really high tempratures which combines protons together forming more protons. The protons soon float and finally reaching the Earth which made us discover it. Uptil the element 92 all the elements are from the supernoavae while from the element 93 onwards they are man made elements.</h4>
          <br><hr class="sep-2" />
          <h1>The Formation of our SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>
          <h4>The Solar system is the place where our Earth Lives. We all know about 1 solar system. But there are trillions of other planets rotating around their own stars! But how did our solar system formed?<br>The solar system </h4>
