      <center><h2>How winds becomes electricity?</h2></center>
      <br><blockquote>
      <p>A place where vast natural force wind is harnessed and turned into electricity is called a wind farm. In a wind farm, the wind turbines capture the wind and turns it into clean re-usable energy ---> ELECTRICITY-</p>
      <hr class="sep-2" />
            <h2>Why use clean renewable energy?</h2>
      <p>From decades and centuries, people have been burning fossil fuels which have increased the amount of carbon dioxide emmisions and also have raised the amount of green house gases. Due to this, the ozone layer is depleting rapidly. In the Antartic Region, there is no ozone layer, as it has already depleted. When we start using clean renewable energy, for electricity, we would completely stop using and burning fossil fuels. This helps in making the Earth back to normal atmospheric conditions.

<h2>DEMOKRATIA</h2>
<h2>MAGNA CARTA</h2><blockquote>
<p>	The Magna Carta(The Great Charter) is one of the most important and famous documents in the world. It all started in the year 1215 when the King of London, King John, regarded as one of the worst rulers in the world killed and harrassed his own people. They demanded the king obey the laws and got the king into negotiation by framing up certain laws. It is filled with different rules which the King or the Queen must follow as the Ruler is not higher than the law. This also stated that- <br><center><i> || "No one shall be PUNISHED until he/she is proven as the victim of the particular case" </i></center><br></p>
  <p> When King john died in 1216, the 9 year old Henry - III, took the throne. To keep the peace,  Magna Carta was re-issued several times during the 13th century until it was made a part of the ENGLISH LAW. This document was declared as the United States independence and also the key document in the world's  human rights. This document also states that the king or the queen or the ruler MUST obey this law or shall be REMOVED PERMENANTLY from the politics and the royal family.

<h2>Democracy</h2><blockquote>
<p>Democracy is a form of government in which people exercise their right to vote by choosing their  representatives for the state or a country.</p></blockquote>
<!-- UNIVERSAL adult franchise -->
<h2>Universal adult franchise</h2><blockquote>
<p>The major feature of democracy is the right to elect or vote our own representatives. The right to vote was not given to all the people in the past. Only men and the influential people were allowed to vote. The suffragate movement in the 19th and the 20th century ensured that women also get the right to vote. However in India, all citizens above the age of 18 irrespective of their caste, creed, religion and gender are given the right to vote. This is called the <b>UNIVERSAL ADULT FRANCHISE</b></p><br><br></blockquote>

<h2>What is ECONOMICS ?</h2>
<aside class="">
  <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp3134853.jpg" class="economics" alt="Economics">
</aside><blockquote>
<p>Economics is a social science that deals with the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. It is all about money being made and money being spent. In this, we can learn about how people become rich or poor.
The economy consists of buyers and sellers. Most of us are both buyers and sellers. We buy what we want and need for our lives and we sell our time and expertise to our employers.<br>

<p>There are times when a lot of people have more money than they need to survive. When this happens, the economy is doing well and the job market is good.   There are times when many people don't have enough money to buy what they need. The economy is not doing good when this happens. In bad economy, people won’t spend too much money. They only buy the things they need and take care of what they already have as the prices of things go up.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Economic and Non economic activities</h5><blockquote>
<p><b>Economic Activity</b>- An economic activity is an activity of providing, making, buying, or selling of commodities or services by people to satisfy their day-to-day needs of life. It can also include activities that deal with the manufacturing, distributing or utilizing of products or services.
<br>
In short, activities that involve money or the exchange of products or services are economic activities.<br> The three types of economic activities are as follows:</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Activity</b></td>
    <td><b>How</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Business</td>
    <td>Provides goods and services to satisfy human needs on a daily basis with the aim of earning profits.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Profession</td>
    <td> An occupation or a professional job that offers specialized services in return for professional charges.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Employment</td>
    <td>Contract between the company and the employee. Here, the employee performs duties for the company, and is paid (with wages or salary) in return.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p><b><h5>Features of Economic Activities:</b></h5><br>• Earning Motive<br>• Utility Creation<br>• Satisfaction<br>• Measurement</p>
<hr class="hrop">
<p><b>Non Economic Activity</b>- A non-economic activity is an activity performed with the purpose of rendering services to others without any considerations of financial gains. Activities that are initiated for personal content or for meeting human sentiments are non-economic activities.<br>

Some common examples of non-economic activities are the following:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Activity</b></td>
    <td><b>How</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Free time activities</td>
    <td>They aim at acquiring pleasure during idle times. For example: painting, and singing, etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Family commitment activities</td>
    <td>These activities are dedicated and inspired by the institution of family. For example, a teacher offering education to own child at home, a doctor consulting a patient in his family, etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cultural and religious activities</td>
    <td>These activities includes the ideas of happiness and mental satisfaction. For example, e.g. worshiping God, visiting the temple, etc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Social welfare activities</td>
    <td>They are based on the passion for helping or sympathising towards others in the society. They include donations to the underprivileged, participation in relief camps to help the people affected by war, natural calamities, etc.</td>
  </tr>

<p><b><h2>The features of Economic Activities: </b></h2><br>• Self Motive<br>• Not measured money<br>• Self Satisfaction<br>• Social Obligation</p>
</blockquote>
  <hr>
  <h5>Goods and Services</h5><blockquote>
  <p>Goods and services are an essential part of an economy. These two terms are used in most of the important economic discussions.

There are many products that a consumer purchases in order to fulfill their certain requirements. These products can be either in the form of goods or services.


The purpose of both goods and services is to provide utility and satisfaction to the consumer.</p>
<p><b><i>GOODS</i></b>- The meaning of goods can be expressed in terms of economics, as any item that provides utility and fulfills the needs of the consumer.

Goods can be classified as durable and non-durable based on their durability. Durable goods last for a long time while non-durable goods perish sooner than durable goods.
<br>
Goods involve transfer of ownership from the seller once it is purchased by the consumer (buyer). There is a certain time period that is required for the production of goods.

Goods due to their tangible nature have a proper structure, size and shape. They can be produced as per the market demand.</p>
<p><b><i>SERVICES</i></b>- Services are the intangible and non physical part of the economy that cannot be touched. They are perishable in nature as they need to be provided at a moment when requested by the consumer.

Service lacks a physical identity and cannot be owned but can only be utilised. For e.g, when having dinner at a restaurant you can avail the concierge services but you do not own the restaurant.<br>

In other words, there is no transfer of ownership in services and unlike goods, services cannot be stored and utilised later. Also, services cannot be distinguished from the service provider.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 style="">Economic Agents</h5><blockquote>
<p>Economic agents are decision makers who can recognize the different factors that influence and motivate different economic groups. They are consumers, producers or influencers of capital markets and the economy at large.</p><Br><br>
  <p>There are four major types of economic agents<br>

-<b>Consumers</b>: One who consumes a produced good or service. Eg: street shoppers, stock brokers<Br>

-<b>Business Firms</b>: Economic agents whose role is to transform factors of production (land,labour,capital and enterprenuer) into goods and services to sell. They can be public and private(Private sector enterprises are owned by a group of individuals or a single entity, while public sector enterprises are owned partially or completely by the government<br>

-<b>Government</b>: An economic agent which provides rules for how firms and consumers should interact<br>
-<b>Banking sector</b>: An economic agent that facilitating business transaction.<br>

<h5>Sectors of Indian Economy</h5>
<blockquote>
  <p>Indian economy is divided into various sectors based on different attibutes. <br><br>
      • Based on the <b>proportion of popoluation engaged in different activities</b> it is divided into three sectors-<b> Primary, Secondary and Tertiary</b>. This categorization represents a continuum of distance from the natural environment. The continuum starts with primary economic activity, which concerns itself with the utilization of raw materials from the earth, such as agriculture and mining. From there, the distance from natural resources increases as sectors become more detached from the processing of raw materials.<br>
      <br>
      Few decades ago, Primary sector was the largest employer because not enough jobs were created in the Secondary and Tertiary sectors. However, lately Tertiary sector has emerged as the largest producing sector in India replacing the Primary sector.
<br><br>
      • In terms of <b>operations</b>, the Indian economy is divided into <b>organized and unorganized</b>.<br>Organized Sector includes those enterprises or places of work where the terms of employment are regular and therefore, people have assured work.<Br>

      Unorganised sector includes small and scattered units which are largely outside the control of the government. Farmers, small scale industry contribute majority into this sector. They need support by providing adequate facility for timely delivery of seeds, agricultural inputs, credit, storage facilities and marketing outlets and for procuring raw material and marketing of output.
<br><br>
            • By <b>ownership</b>, it is divided into the <b>public sector and private sector</b>.<br>
 In the public sector, the government owns most of the assets and provides all the services.<Br>
 In the private sector, private individuals or companies own assets and are responsible for delivery of services.
    </p></blockquote>
    <br>

<h5>How to Create More Employment?</h5><blockquote>
<p>• The government can spend some money or banks can provide a loan for people having large plots of unirrigated land, to construct a well to irrigate the land.<br>

• Identify, promote and locate industries and services in semi-rural areas where a large number of people may be employed.<br>

• To improve the health situation, many more doctors, nurses, health workers etc are required to work in rural areas.<br>

• Develop tourism, regional craft industry or new services like IT. Tourism can provide every year additional employment to more than 35 lakh people.<br>

• India made a law called Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA 2005), implementing the Right to Work in about 625 districts of India.<br>
