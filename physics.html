          <p>When we listen to the beautiful sounds of stereo, we are actually listening to the rythyms of trillions of electrons obeying us. Sound is important. We use sound for verbal communication. The words which we speak and the song being played
          in the rythym box produce sound which we are able to hear. Do you know what is Acoustics ? Acoustics is the study of sound. It is branch of physics that deals with the study of mechanical waves in gases, liquids and solids. Like eyes detect
          light and color, our ears help in the hearing of sound.</p></blockquote>


    <div id="introtosound"><blockquote>
      <h2>Types of Sounds: </h2></blockquote>
            <blockquote><p>There are variety of sounds ranging from faint sounds to loud sounds. - <br>Infrasonic: Sounds with a frequency below 20Hz. EThese sounds are used to detect petrol formation under the Earth and Possibility of Earthquakes. <br> Audible: Sound range which human ear can detect. The audible range is 20 Hz, to 20,000 Hz & <br>Ultra sonic:  Sounds with a frquency above
          20,000 Hz. Used in measuring distances and in detecting objects.</p></blockquote>

      <h2>How sound travels?</h2></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>

        Sound is a vibration. It is created by vibrating objects and is then propagated through a medium from one location to another. This is known as "Propogation Of SOUND".<br>
        It can travel through any medium(Gases, liquids and solids)but not in vacuum. Which is why there is no sound in space.

    </div>
    <div id="Characteristicsofsound">
<blockquote>
    <h2>Characteristics of sound:</h2></blockquote><blockquote>
      <p>Unlike Light, Sound needs a medium to travel. Sound waves are longitudinal/mechanical waves as the motion of the air particles is in direction that is parallel to the direction of energy transport. Because of this motion, there are regions in the air where the air particles are compressed together forming high air pressure known as Compressions and the regions where
        the air particles are spread apart forming low air pressure known as rarefactions. Due to this repeating pattern of high and low air pressures moving through a medium, sound is also referred as a pressure wave.</p></blockquote><blockquote></div>

        <h2>DOPPLER EFFECT: </h2></blockquote><blockquote>
          <p>The Doppler effect is the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. It is caused because the distance between the source of sound and the observer is changing. If the source and observer is approaching, the distance is decreasing and if they are moving apart, the distance increases.</p><blockquote><p>The source always emmits same frequency .Therefore, for same period of time, if the distance is large, the wave spread apart forming low pitch. Where as if the disatance shortens, the wave compresses forming high pitch.<br>A common example is the high pitch of horn observed when the train approaches and low pitch when the train passes away.

            <p>When one object vibrating at it's natural frquency forces a second object into vibrational motion is called as resonance. This happens only when the natural frequency of the first object is same as the natural frequency of the second object. Example- The sound of sea heard when a sea shell is placed near the ear is due to the resonance.

            <h2>Echo</h2></blockquote><blockquote>
              <p> Echo is the reflection of sound that arrives at the listener with a delay after the direct sound.The delay is directly propotional to the distance of the reflecting surface from the source and the listener. Example : An empty house with no furniture. The Walls reflect the sound
                back to the ears. Study says that the Human brain stores a sound for 0.1 seconds. Hence, an echo is heard ONLY if the reflected sound arrives later than 0.1 seconds from the original sound.</p>

                  line: Take 3 cardboard pieces and 1 candle. Drill a hole in the center of the 3 cardboard pieces and place them on the ground with equal distance from each other. Then place a candle at one end. When you see through the holes
                  in the cardboard, you can see the candle but when you move any of the cardboard , you cant see the candle. This proves that Light travels in straight line. </p>
