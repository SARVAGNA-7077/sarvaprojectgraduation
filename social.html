         This video in the left tells you all about how wind turns into electricity and how can we use electricity in different ways. It also tells you all about how and why should we use cars which fo not produce pollution. I am also going to cover about
         how to reduce and the negative effects about the CO<sub>2</sub> emmisions.</sub>

      <h3>How winds become electricity?</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>A place where vast natural force wind is harnessed and turned into electricity is called as a wind farm. In a wind farm, the wind turbines capture the wind and turns it into clean re-usable energy ---> ELECTRICITY-</h4>

      <h3>Why use clean renuable energy?</h3>
      <h4>From decades and centuries, people has been burning fossil fuels which have increased the amount of carbon dioxide emmisions and also have raised the amount of green house gases. Due to this, the ozone layer is depleting rapidly and also in the Antartic
         Region, there is no ozone layer as it depleted. When we start using clean renuable energy which is electricity, we would completely stop using and burning fossil fuels. This helps in making the Earth back to normal atmosphereic condition.
