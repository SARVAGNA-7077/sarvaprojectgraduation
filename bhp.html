    <h2>What is Big history?</h2><hr class="sep-2" />
<blockquote>
    <p>The Big History Project is a joint effort between teachers, scholars, scientists, and their supporters to bring a multi-disciplinary approach to knowledge to lifelong learners around the world. This was co-founded by Bill Gates and David Christian to enable the global teaching of the subject of Big History, which is described as "the attempt to understand, in a unified way, the history of Cosmos, Earth, Life and Humanity. Many of you might have learned social from the revolution or also from the harrapan civilization.... but Big History explains every thing from the Big Bang to the </p></blockquote><br><br>

    <!-- The Formation Of Our Universe-->
       <div class="formationUniverse">
         <h1>THE FORMATION OF OUR UNIVERSE</h1>

         <blockquote>
          <p>The universe, is all formed by a huge mass explosion called the BIG BANG.</p><p>THE BIG BANG, in a fraction of a second, created the 4 Fundemental forces of the universe namely- <b>> Gravity,<br> > Electromagnetism,<br> > Strong force and the<br> > weak force.</b></p>
          <p>Soon later, after the big band happened, within a span of 3 seconds, all of the matter has been created </p>
          <p>The universe was around 10 billion kelvins from the time Big Bang occurred. So, after the universe has cooled down, the first stars had lighted up the complete empty blank space</p></blockquote>
          <hr class="sep-2" /><h1>STARS LIGHT UP</h1>
          <blockquote>
            <p>When you all see the night sky, it glows, the stars make it shinier! But how are star so bright and how are they formed?<br>When the big bang occurred there were really few elements. Only upto 7 or 8. Hydrogen covered around 75% of the universe while Helium covered about 24% of the universe. The remaining 1% is the other elements. When Huge clouds of Hydrogen and Helium Combine together, due to the friction, it creates HUGE amount of light. That lights up the gasses forming huge balls of FIRE, Stars. Stars are the main fuel for the light in the universe.</p>
            <p>The stars also helped in giving more elements. When a star dies, it's called as supernova. The super nova have really high tempratures which combines protons together forming more protons. The protons soon float and finally reaching the Earth which made us discover it. Uptil the element 92 all the elements are from the supernoavae while from the element 93 onwards they are man made elements.</p>

          <h1>The Formation of our SOLAR SYSTEM</h1><blockquote>

          <p>The Solar system is the place where our Earth Lives. We all know about 1 solar system. But there are trillions of other planets rotating around their own stars! But how did our solar system formed?<br>The Sun and the planets formed together, 4.6 billion years ago, from a cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. A shock wave from a nearby supernova explosion probably initiated the collapse of the solar nebula. The Sun formed in the center, and the planets formed in a thin disk orbiting around it.<br>The matter which different supernoavae have released out, 99% of that matter was absorbed the by the sun while the 1% of the matter formed the Earth and the other planets. <br></p></blockquote>
          <hr class="sep-2"/>
          <h1>The formation of our EARTH</h1>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The Earth was formed with trillions of ancient debris. The left over matter revolved around the sun and soon later, they started combining and colliding with each other. It soon made a small clump of huge molted ball which is the starting stage of the Earth.<br> The Earth soon later cooled down forming a Hard layer on it called the crust.<br> After a few million years later, an object size of Mars has collided onto the Earth. The lump has soon come out of the EARTH forming an object revolving the Earth. This is the moon. The formation of the moon has helped the earth in various ways such as stabalizing the earth's tilt.<br> The Earth again cooled down forming the crust again. <br> The Formation of Jupiter also helped in the formation of the Earth. Due to the Jupiter's strong gracitatinoal pull, It controlled the astroid belt from hitting the Earth.<br>The earth cooled down again forming oceans and seas with the help of rain. Soon, the Earth started forming life.</p>
       </div></blockquote><hr class="sep-2" />
       <h1>The formation of LIFE</h1>
       <blockquote>
         <p>The life was formed with the help of Bacteria known as Cynobacteria. The Cyanobacteria played an important role in the evolution of Early Earth and the biosphere. They are responsible for the oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans since the Great Oxidation Event around 2.4â€¯Billion years ago, debatably earlier. They are also major primary producers in past and present oceans, and the ancestors of the chloroplast and some plants. Nevertheless, the identification of cyanobacteria in the early fossil record remains ambiguous because the morphological criteria commonly used are not always reliable for microfossil interpretation.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>After the bacteria gave rise to the oxygen levels, the Algae was formed. Algae is the ancestors of the plants. To prove this, scientists have discovered that the modern Green Algae and the Plant use Photosynthesis for the production of food and also store food in the form of Starch. They both use the same type of Chlorophyll too. The modern green algae started living on land about 1 Billion years ago. As the green algae evolved by migrating on land, The land plants needed to develop some important tools which helps in the formation of a complete plant. The plants have developed roots to absorb water and minerals. They developed stems for reaching the sunlight and the growth of the plant and also sending the water and minerals throught the plant. They developed Leaves which helped in Photosynthesis. They soon developed seeds which started the formation of the Plant and Animal kingdom.</p>
